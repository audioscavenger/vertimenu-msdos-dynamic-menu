## not using your crap tokens
Using tokens makes github more unsecure.

Why? Simply because once you generate a token and close the window, you cannot access it anymore. Therefore, since no human being is able to remember them, people are gonna start using text files, password managers and watnot.

How is a password saved in a text file more secure then one that is not, one that I can remember?

## On August 13, 2021, github.com created a total mess and I'm outta here. Here is why:
- tokens are just long passwords, which I already was using. No improvements, only headaches.
- tokens are not more secure then passwords since they are basically the same.
- tokens make our life misearable.
- could not obtainvaluable help on the forums to enable SSH.
- github did not provide a single guide to convert all you local repos to SSH or tokens easily.
- I claim that github.com do not care about users anymore.
- I am leaving the multi-million$ github "community". Oh wait isn't that owned by M$?
